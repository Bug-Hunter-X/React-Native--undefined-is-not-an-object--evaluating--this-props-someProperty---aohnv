This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state or props before the component has fully mounted or rendered.  This often happens within lifecycle methods like `constructor` or `componentWillMount` (though this lifecycle method is now deprecated).  React Native components might not yet have their `this.props` or `this.state` properly initialized at those early stages.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: this.props.initialCount }; // Error prone!  'this.props' might not be set yet.
}

// Correct:
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 }; // Initialize with a default value
}

componentDidMount() {
  // Access this.props safely here.
  this.setState({ count: this.props.initialCount });
}
```
